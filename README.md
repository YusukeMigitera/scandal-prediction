# scandal-prediction

A prediction market platform focused on stock price fluctuations caused by scandals. The platform would allow users to bet on the percentage drop in stock prices and earn rewards for accurate predictions. It's a specialized version of an existing platform for this purpose.

## Description

The app allows users to create new predictions or bet ETH on existing predictions.

The betting procedure is as follows.

1. Select the prediction you are interested in on the list page.
2. Place your bet by selecting yes/no and the amount.
3. The bet is closed when it is the betting deadline or the stock price drops to the predicted price.
4. The prediction is closed when it is the prediction deadline or the stock price drops to the predicted price.
5. When the prediction closes, the bet is split among those who correctly guessed the price.

Information about when and how much it will decrease is valuable. If the company is stable, even if the stock price decreases due to a scandal, it will return to normal after a while. There is an opportunity to make money from the difference.
